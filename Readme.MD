#Week 3 Challenge

This project includes: 
 
- An automatically increasing ID (so that you can see how it could be done) 
- Code for you to complete - put the return book functionality in the project and complete the menu! 
- A way to overload the list books method 
- Many many many many methods 
- A small main method 
- An example of how you can use a method to display text WITHOUT a System.out.println statement in the method. 

Have fun looking through the code, and do ask any questions if you have them!
